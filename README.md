So for  the portfolio website I started with giving a navigation bar using a div tag and for this navbar I have used a div tag containing heading of portfolio and other links containing text for the navigation between different sections of the portfolio like home about me contact me and projects for the links I used the anchor tag and have given the same class name I also used hover effect so that whenever I hover the mouse above the text changes to the colour given and for the heading portfolio I have given another class and I have copy pasted the same navbar for the different sections of the navbar so that I could navigate easily back and foreth . I have also given it a background colour. Next further text in the home section I have created  2 divs the first div containing image of mine and the second is the context basic two lines about me and the both dives have the same class so that I could give padding for both of them at the same time and also have given individual class names for both of them so that I could give different adjustment in css


Next for the about me section I have here used 2 files 1 file for the skills and other file for the education sections this is so that I can navigate between two sections for the same section in the nav bar of about me  the first file I have given the content for the skills section and f0r the another file in  about me I have given the context of education for about me section for both the section of the basic about me which you can see and the centre about the both section . Here for the common text I have just used a div tag and paragraph tag within it . Then I have named a class same like the navigation bar for skills and education and have given links for both of them for with the file names so when clicking on both of them it changes or navigate between or among them for the text in them I have used another div tag and for the headings I have given colour.


Next for the project section I have give it a common heading project using a h tag and then I have created two div tags  explaining the two different projects it's  had a background colour and a basic context explaining the project and image as a cover page of the project below that I have given a link directing to that project. Please not that the links are misplaced between them and each link takes you to a different project as shown in the above image or context said.

In this project first started with using a div tag with a class image and inside this due tag I used another day tag with name text and inside this I have used another span tag to write the text in the box the reason I have used to tags is that for the first day you tag image I have set it as a background and I have used here css properties like background position centre background repeat no and background attachment fixed the background position centre is to align the image to the exact centre and then I have given the width 100% so that it correctly fixed to the width of the screen and position relative so that it becomes responsive after changing the width and the height of the device the fixed attachment position and for each image with the different classes I have given the height and I have given the URL for the images next for the text which is displayed in the centre of the image I have used CSS I have used here properties like top and left so that I could bring that box to the centre of the background image.

For each text I have manually updated the top and left percentage is so that it comes to the centre then I have given the colour of the font font size and text align centre with a border radius for the box after this image I have created another section which contains the text describing about the location in that I have used properties like padding and a background colour . The main CSS property that gives a good look is the background attachment fixed so that the image is fixed but the text feels to move or glide above that.


And for the second project I have first started with the basic navbar which contains the logo of the restaurant I have given it a background colour and padding to that  image.  Next below that I have given a div tag consisting of two div tags one for the image and one for the text beside , both the div tags have the same class and also had different class names so that I could adjust the padding for both them simultaneously and for different properties I could use different class names for the image . I have use the IMG src tag and for the text I have given paragraph tags and given different ID names so that I could use different font size and colours .Below that I have mentioned another div  tag consisting of another 3 due tags within it which had three different sections all three sections had a same class name for a padding and also different class names so that I could give different images and font size below that I have given a button type box and aligned it to the centre of the page and after that I made a collage type of design using the grid feature of CSS in this I have given each image a area name and then arrange them in the grid format so they align to this shape then last I have given a footer consisting of links for various functions of the restaurant this is done inside a div tag


Next for the contact me section here I have given a heading for the contact me text using h tag then I have created two div tags for the contacts on the left and for the context on the right for the form type of input  I have given basic text like a heading and data and for the heading I have given a common ID so that I could give a common colour and font size for all three of them next I have given the icons social icon by importing them from baux icons website just search them in the website and you will get a code for them use the tag and insert that link in there also use the common link in the style tag about so that it becomes functionalFor the input in the type of form I used basic form tag which contains a paragraph with the headings and their input types as there data entry place I have used three types of inputs one text ,the second email and the third message. I have also created a button submit at the end.
